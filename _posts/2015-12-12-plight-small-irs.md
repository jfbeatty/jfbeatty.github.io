Mary Wu, ["The Future of Institutional Repositories at Small Academic Institutions: Analysis and Insights,"](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september15/wu/09wu.html) _D-Lib_ 21, no. 9-10 (2015):

> The success of institutional repositories at academic institutions in general and small universities in particular relies on the expansion of service to a broad spectrum of the academic arena beyond their conventional roles of preservation and dissemination of faculty and student scholarship. Despite the unique challenges they face, repositories at small academic institutions can grow as long as they prove themselves an asset in undergraduate education.

Or, the success of institutional repositories depends on their becoming something other than institutional repositories.

Not making light of this --- it's been my experience as well.
