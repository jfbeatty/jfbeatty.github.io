Maha Bali [encouraged her students to created their own learning taxonomies](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/what-i-learned-from-student-created-learning-taxonomies/62014):

> The idea of the assignment was inspired by an [activity Sean Michael Morris created](http://www.digitalpedagogylab.com/subversion-and-instructional-design/) where we hacked (well re-thought) Bloom’s Taxonomy during the recent #MOOOCMOOC Instructional Design. It was also partly inspired by Amy Collier’s keynote here at Digital Pedagogy Cairo ([recorded here](http://lectures.aucegypt.edu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=e2ce6c8c-46c6-4022-ba3e-0bf43ffd6386)) which referred to a recent [presentation by Gardner Campbell using a taxonomy of engagement](http://www.gardnercampbell.net/blog1/?p=2511) which focused on love.

Point 3 particularly struck me:

> **Interest is Underrated by Bloom, But Valued by Students**. Many students caught onto Gardner/Amy’s ideas of interest, passion, inspiration, and so on. Almost every student-created taxonomy mentioned this.

I'm dubious of Bloom's taxonomy, primarily because of its origins in a post-WWII educational climate centered on a narrow, anti-Communist liberal orthodoxy. Collier and Campbell's presentations are going on my to-watch list.
