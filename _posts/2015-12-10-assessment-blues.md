A new volume from ACRL, [_Reviewing the Academic Library: A Guide to Self-Study and External Review_](http://www.acrl.ala.org/acrlinsider/archives/10794):

> Whether the library assessment is driven by external pressure or by an organizationally inspired desire to improve...

This distinction between external and internal assessment is framed by defenders of the latter as "bad" versus "good." Titles and blurbs like these don't help convince me there's a difference.
