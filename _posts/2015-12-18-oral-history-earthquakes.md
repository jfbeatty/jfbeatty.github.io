Ann Finkbeiner, ["The Great Quake and the Great Drowning,"](http://www.hakaimagazine.com/article-long/great-quake-and-great-drowning) in _Hakai_:

> From the Tolowa people in northern California: one autumn, the earth shook and the water began rising. People began running and when the water reached them, they turned into snakes. But a girl and a boy from the village, both adolescents, outran the water by running to the top of a mountain where they built a fire to keep themselves warm.

The New Yorker article ["The Really Big One"](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one) touched briefly on the earthquake stories of the Pacific Northwest's indigenous peoples. Finkbeiner's piece is centered on those same stories. Very much worth reading.
