title: On the impeachment of Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff
---
Last night the lower house of the Brazilian legislature [voted to impeach](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/18/dilma-rousseff-congress-impeach-brazilian-president) President Dilma Rousseff. Rousseff is a member of the *Partido dos Trabalhadores*, or Workers' Party. This is the party to which Paulo Freire belonged, and under which he served as the Secretary of Education for São Paulo in the late 1980s.

What was particularly jarring to me was the rhetoric that celebrated the military dictatorship of the 1960s and 70s, the regime that imprisoned and exiled Freire and tortured Rousseff:

> On a dark night, arguably the lowest point was when Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right deputy from Rio de Janeiro, dedicated his yes vote to Carlos Brilhante Ustra, the colonel who headed the Doi-Codi torture unit during the dictatorship era. Rousseff, a former guerrilla, was among those tortured. Bolsonaro’s move prompted left-wing deputy Jean Wyllys to spit towards him.

> Eduardo Bolsonaro, his son and also a deputy, used his time at the microphone to honour the general responsible for the military coup in 1964.

Rousseff, as a guerrilla, was thus one of the "revolutionary leaders" for whom Freire wrote _Pedagogy of the Oppressed_.

Glenn Greenwald [interviewed Lula a week before the impeachment](https://theintercept.com/2016/04/11/watch-exclusive-interview-with-former-brazilian-president-lula-da-silva/); it's worth reading.
