new intro: C&T rely on Collins theory. What struck me is how material the theory is, how it's easy to see not just institutions contributing to dynamic belonging but spaces. Here's an example, from one of authors' favorite places: the Science Center. 

Then tension between exclusivity and critical librarianship inclusivity.

The liberal arts college is selective, but C&T find that within the college the sciences represent a further refinement. Students in the sciences regard themselves as an elite. They come better prepared from their high schools and  take harder courses in college. And the authors concur that science courses really are more rigorous than those in other departments. Yet the result is that women are underrepresented, in part because poor introductory teachers drive them to other majors. Students with less preparation from high school are also at a disadvantage. Moreover, science is increasingly taught via research-based education, which may be better for future scientists but not for the majority of students. In short, the authors see a rigorous science education as a good thing, and something that should be available to more than a relatively small, self-selected share of students (119-126).

C&T rely on Randall Collins's theory of "how emotionally bonded groups come to exist." The sciences at Hamilton display the four requirements necessary for such a "dynamics of belonging." The Science Center, and its many labs and classrooms designed for different disciplines, provide for the _physical copresence_ of people.[^mooc] Lab experiments and activities make for a _shared focus of attention_, and for _ritualized common activities_. And the Science Center's existence, set off from the rest of the college, as well as science students' perceived status as an elite, give the sciences an _exclusivity_ based on clearly defined boundaries (79-81).

Though the Science Center is set off, another center is well integrated into college life. The Writing Center enjoys a particular status because of the importance of writing at the college. The student tutors at the Writing Center meet peers from across the disparate subcommunities on the campus and thuse are near the center of the larger social network amont Hamilton students --- thus reinforcing the curricular primacy of writing at the college. The Writing Center, then, gives up some of the exclusivity of the sciences for a deeper integration across the college.

Taking the Science Center and the Writing Center together may allow libraries to consider their role as a physical space. Libraries can, like the Science Center, fulfill Collins's four requirements for a dynamics of belonging. The library allows for physical copresence with one's peers. The work done at the library forms a ritualized common activity. And those students who spend time in the library come to recognize each other and to consider themselves an exclusive set.

This leaves out the second of Collins's requirements: that there be a shared focus of attention. When considering the library as a study space, there is a tension between this requirement and C&T's argument that study alone is more effective than in groups. When studying alone, even co-present people have different foci of attention. 

In a well-intentioned effort to promote the network of relationships essential for success at college, libraries have moved away from their traditional role as a space for concentrated individual study and instead introduced innovations like lounges, presentation rooms, and the information commons. And libraries should embrace that role, for it's what they, better than anyone else on campus, can provide. So to enable the copresence of peers around the ritualized common activity of concentrated study, in an atmosphere that asserts the importance and the exclusivity of that concentrated study, that, surely, is how the physical space of the library can best help college to work.

[^mooc]: C&T are, unsurprisingly, not big fans of MOOCs or of online learning in general.
