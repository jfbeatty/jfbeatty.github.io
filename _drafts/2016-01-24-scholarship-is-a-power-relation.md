Last week a faculty member asked if Zotero could pull in metadata for articles even when there isn't a PDF to associate with it. (Like any bibliographic management program, the answer is yes). They explained that often the journal editor will ask them to add citations to articles from the same journal in order to increase impact factor. The professor was matter-of-fact about it, so much so that I didn't really think about it at the time.

But, really, WTF? Of course I've heard of the practice before. But from this conversation it seemed like it was an accepted fact of publishing, at least in this person's field. They had no interest in looking at the items they were going to cite. They just wanted the metadata so they could slot it into their manuscript.

The ACRL Framework takes as one of its six frames that "scholarship is a conversation". But where is the conversation here? It's a monologue gussied up to look like a conversation, by adding in imagined participants.
