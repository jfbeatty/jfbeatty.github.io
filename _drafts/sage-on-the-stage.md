While researching my Freire paper I became curious about the origins of a particular phrase, or rather pair of phrases, that have become ubiquitous within the IL community. Better to be a "guide on the side" than a "sage on the stage," says the literature.

The source usually credited with coining the phrases is TK. But using modern discovery tools (Google Scholar, Google Books, and JSTOR) it's possible to find earlier uses of the phrases. So far the earliest use I've found is from a 1969 article in the educational journal _The Clearing House_.

Robert Eberle, in "The Open Space School," wrote:

> Individuality can best be respected and cultivated when the teachers' role shifts from familiar "sage on the stage" to the helping relationship of "a guide on the side." (p. 24)

"little astrodome for living and learning" (p. 24)
