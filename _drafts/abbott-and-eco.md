Recent conversation with, among others, Chris Bourg and Jessica Olin on Andrew Abbott's work with libraries, especially his book _Digital Paper_ on the research process. We disliked what we called the elitism of the book. I thought it would be worthwhile to talk more about what bothers me about _Digital Paper_ and to look at alternatives.

Elitism: what do we mean
- assumption that only deep research library work is worthwhile/worthy of name "research"
- assumption that one has access to particular sources
- assumption that one has significant personal physical space, preferably in the research library itself
- point of research is scholarly approval -- thesis housed in stacks at research library, or, better, publication

Treatment of libraries/librarians also elitist
- scholars always know better
- historical takeover of academic libraries by librarians, decline of disciplinary libraries, ruinous
- Freudian field day: Oedipus complex

Reception of _Digital Paper_
- see the Savage Minds review -- best guide ever
- so researchers like it, or at least aspire to the image it contains
